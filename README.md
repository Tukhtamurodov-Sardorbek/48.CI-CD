# Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery

> Continuous Integration (CI) - `is a practice to merge all developer working code from different branches and integrate it into a single branch in the repository`
> Modern continuous integration tools enable development teams to have more confidence,
> by automatically building and testing and also providing earlier feedback.


> Continuous Delivery (CD) - `is an approach to deliver our latest code, bug fixes, new features, or any changes to production or to users safely`
> Our application is not only built and tested at every code change pushed to the codebase,
> but as an additional step, itâ€™s also deployed continuously,
> though the deployments are triggered manually.
